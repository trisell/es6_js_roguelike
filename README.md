# es6_js_roguelike

This is a es6 conversion of the rot.js roguelike tutorial on [Coding Cookies.](http://www.codingcookies.com/2013/04/01/building-a-roguelike-in-javascript-part-1/)

It also is built to run on the terminal on not in a browser. This means that things like keyboard handling have been moved out of the browser methods and into node stdin processes. This necessitates a little more complexiity as we cannot use the built in rot.js keyboard handling.

You can find each part of the tutorial under it's own branch.
